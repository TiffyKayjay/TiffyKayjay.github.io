            <div class="project-description">
              In this project, I first looked at the title of each clip and highlighted them in different colours according to themes, and selected three themes: climate change, hurricane, and rebuilding. I then put those clips into my timeline. From there, I worked on cutting the video down from about 30 ish minutes to 5 minutes. After that, I added B-roll and music to make the documentary interesting and for the viewers to be able to visualise some of the things each person was talking about. Now that the main part of the documentary was edited, I added a 25-second opening sequence to create the atmosphere of the video.

              In this project, I first looked at the audio log and synced the audio with the video. From there, I found the storyline of this advertisement for an app, and edited the synced clips according to the storyline. I then created the logo and icons appearing in Adobe After Effects. On top of this, I did motion tracking in Mocha VFX in Adobe After Effects to add the grandmother talking through the app appear on the phone that the grandchild was using. After making sure everything is smooth and that the advert is 1 minute 30 seconds, I then colour graded in DaVinci Resolve.
