            </div>
            <div class="project-description">
              In this project, I first looked at the transcript and highlighted the themes I wanted to include (assumptions about artists, money, how Michael paints). I then put those clips into my timeline. From there, I worked on cutting the video down from 10 minutes to 3 minutes. After that, I added B-roll and music to make the documentary interesting and for the viewers to be able to visualise some of the things he was talking about. I also added title credits at the beginning of each theme so that there was no confusion on what Michael was talking about. Now that the main part of the documentary was edited, I added a 15-second opening sequence to create the atmosphere of the video.

            <div class="project-description">
              In this project, I first came up with the story idea. As the video is supposed to be only 30 seconds, I focused on one character. I then created a storyboard, a general character image and a general house image. I gave these to my artist friend. I put all the images into Premiere Pro, chose a music from YouTube Audio Library, and put the images into the timeline in the story order, and added sound effects where necessary.

              In this project, I first looked at the transcript, and chose a t=general theme, drawing and art. I then put the interview clips related to the theme in the timeline, added B-roll of the city and the mural, and added music.
