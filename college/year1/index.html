              <span class="project-title">Requirements for a British Film Production</span> - Make a trailer for an original film
            </div>
            <div class="project-description">
              In this project, I first researched the requirements for a British film production: type of production (mainstream, feature), unique selling point, finance (budget), timescale (planning, filming, editing), personnel (crew), facilities (cameras, microphones...), materials (sound effects, narration, music, graphics), contributors (actors), location and codes of practice (the British Board of Film Classification: U, PG, 12A, 12, 15, 18). This research has helped me to be more knowledgeable of the pre-production process and the importance of the planning process. The next thing I did was create a production schedule, a contingency plan, a recce of the filming locations, a storyboard of the trailer, a risk assessment form for the filming locations, and consent forms from the actors. After these were done, I filmed and edited the trailer.
