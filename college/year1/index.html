              <span class="project-title">Requirements for a British Film Production</span> - Make a trailer for an original film
            </div>
            <div class="project-description">
              In this project, I first researched the requirements for a British film production: type of production (mainstream, feature), unique selling point, finance (budget), timescale (planning, filming, editing), personnel (crew), facilities (cameras, microphones...), materials (sound effects, narration, music, graphics), contributors (actors), location and codes of practice (the British Board of Film Classification: U, PG, 12A, 12, 15, 18). This research has helped me to be more knowledgeable of the pre-production process and the importance of the planning process. The next thing I did was create a production schedule, a contingency plan, a recce of the filming locations, a storyboard of the trailer, a risk assessment form for the filming locations, and consent forms from the actors. After these were done, I filmed and edited the trailer.

              <span class="project-title">The Principles of Editing</span> - Make an advert of a product
            </div>
            <div class="project-description">
              In this project, I first compared different editing softwares (iMovie, Adobe Premiere Pro, CyberLink PowerDirector 365), then analysed a Pizza Hut advert (slow-motion: yummy, tasty, delicious; mode of address: informal language "Uy!", "Try the new pan pizza only at Pizza Hut", actors not facing the viewers, making them feel isolated, which urges them to join in; soft sell advert because it dorsn't directly address the viewer to buy the new pan pizza; visual codes: actors wearing plain clothing to make the pizza stand out, actors altering their facial expression to emphasise that the new pan pizza is very delicious). This research has helped me to understand more about advertising. The next thing I did was to look at editing techniques, such as importing footage into the library, adding transitions between clips, and many more. After doing this, I then filmed and edited the advert.
